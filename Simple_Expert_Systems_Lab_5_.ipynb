It asks questions only when needed to confirm the goal, making it more focused and efficient. Forward chaining, on the other hand, starts with known facts by asking initial questions and then iteratively applies rules to deduce all possible conclusions. This means it may ask questions that are not directly relevant to a specific goal, and the order of questions is more fixed, which can feel less efficient from the user’s perspective.\n",

Doctors usually start with a specific disease in mind, so the system can ask only the questions needed to confirm or rule out that disease. This saves time and avoids unnecessary questions. Forward chaining, on the other hand, asks many questions to figure out all possible conditions, which can overwhelm the patient with irrelevant queries.\n",

        "1) Explain the benefits of this design. Why is it better to have two specialized agents rather than one single, massive agent that handles botth the general chat and expert-level reasoning?\n",
        "\n",
        "UppBot manages casual chat, greetings, and sentiment detection, while the expert system focuses on applying rules to identify animals. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What are the trade-offfs of this multi-agent approach? Can you identify any potential drawbacks or challenges?\n",
        "\n",
        "The main challenge is making sure the program knows which agent should handle each user input. As we add more agents, deciding who answers can get tricky.  Another drawback is that the agents might sound different from each other, which could make the conversation feel less smooth.\n",
        "Having two specialized agents provides better organization, flexibility, and long-term maintainability compared to one massive, all-in-one agent. The extra coordination effort and potential for inconsistencies are minor compared to the advantages of clarity, modularity, and ease of future expansion"
