To move toward model-based behavior, UppBot would need to store user information, track whether it has already greeted the user, and maintain context across the conversation."

        "the rules that use the agent's internal model are primarily centered around tracking the user's name and whether the bot has greeted the user before. For example, when the user says “my name is …”, UppBot stores the name in the internal model and later uses it to personalize responses, such as greeting the user by name or responding more warmly when asked how it is doing. Similarly, the bot checks the greeted_before flag to avoid repeating greetings unnecessarily, allowing it to vary responses depending on whether it's the first interaction in the session or a follow-up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Does UppBot now feel more \"intelligent\"?\n",
        "Yes,because it can remember small pieces of context and adjust its behavior accordingly. Unlike a simple keyword-based bot that responds the same way every time, UppBot's responses are stateful and context-aware.\n",
        "\n",
        "How does the agent's internal model enable more complex behavior?\n",
        "The agent's internal model enables more complex behavior by acting as a memory structure that the bot can reference when deciding how to respond. Even with just the user's name and greeting status, UppBot can generate personalized and conditional responses. This model allows the bot to maintain continuity in conversations, respond differently to repeated interactions, and make replies that depend on stored information rather than just detecting keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "How could we make UppBot feel even more intelligent?\n",
        "To make UppBot feel even more intelligent, the internal model could be expanded to track additional information about the user, such as interests, past conversation topics, preferences, or even the user's mood. The bot could then use this information to ask relevant follow-up questions, suggest topics, or avoid repeating information."

        "How does UppBot's behaviour change with sentiment?\n",
        "it first evaluates the sentiment of the user's input using the analyse_sentiment function. If the sentiment is negative, UppBot responds with empathy: \"I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better.\" If it is positive, it responds with encouragement: \"That's great! I'm glad to hear that.\" Only if the sentiment is neutral does it fall back to the traditional rule-based keyword responses. This gives the bot the ability to adapt its tone and response style to the emotional state of the user, making the interaction feel more human-like.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the role of the analyse_sentiment function? Is it a sensor or an actuator?\n",
        "The analyse_sentiment function acts as a sensor rather than an actuator. In agent terminology, a sensor detects information from the user's input and provides data that the agent can use to make decisions. Here, the function analyzes the polarity of the text to categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral. The bot then uses this information to decide how to respond appropriately. It does not perform an action itself it only provides the perception data that guides the bot's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "What are the benefits of an agent having a \"sensor\" like this?\n",
        "It allows the agent to respond in a more personalized and emotionally intelligent way, which can improve user engagement and satisfaction. Second, it enables the agent to prioritize responses based on the user's emotional state—for example, offering sympathy if the user is upset, rather than giving a neutral or inappropriate response. Third, it sets the foundation for more sophisticated behaviors, such as adjusting dialogue style over time, detecting frustration, or providing encouragement, all of which make the agent appear more intelligent and socially aware."

        "What conversations do they have?\n",
        "When bot1 and bot2 converse using the current UppBot implementation, their dialogue is mostly repetitive and shallow. The bots rely on simple rule-based responses and basic sentiment analysis, without awareness of the conversation context beyond the last input. For instance, the conversation might start with Bot1 saying “Hello there! How can I help you today?” and Bot2 responding with “I’m not sure how to respond to that.” Subsequent turns often continue with both bots repeating the same neutral or generic statements because the responses from one bot do not provide meaningful cues for the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can you modify the UppBot agent program logic to change the outcome of their conversations?\n",
        "The outcome of these conversations can be changed by modifying UppBot's internal logic. One approach is to add memory for previous messages, allowing each bot to reference prior exchanges and build on them, which creates a more coherent multi-turn dialogue. Another method is to make the bots aware of their interlocutors, tracking who they are speaking with and adjusting responses accordingly. Expanding the rule set to include conversational patterns, such as asking follow-up questions or making statements relevant to the other bot's input, can make interactions more dynamic.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is challenging when we consider multiple agents communicating with one another?\n",
        "Multiple-agent communication has several challenges. Each agent needs to remember the conversation to avoid repeating or contradicting itself. Agents must also take turns properly so the dialogue flows naturally. Understanding the meaning of messages can be difficult, and without it, responses may feel literal or meaningless. Sometimes, bots can get stuck in loops or produce unintended patterns. To have smooth conversations, agents need good memory, clear interaction rules, and awareness of context.\n"
